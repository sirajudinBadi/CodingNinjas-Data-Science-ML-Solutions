"""
Problem statement
For the given dataset "FuelEconomy.csv"

Create a Linear Regressor and fit the dataset in this. After that, print the coefficient and intercept.

Note:

 1. Inside the function "train_test_split", use the "random_state = 42".
 2. Split the dataset in the ratio of 70:30 into the training and testing datasets.
To know more about randomstate please read the document given regarding randomstate.

Output

Print the coefficient and intercept in separate lines rounded off to 2 decimal places.
