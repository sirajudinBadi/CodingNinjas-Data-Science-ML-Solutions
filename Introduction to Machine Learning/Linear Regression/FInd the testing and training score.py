"""
Problem statement
For the given dataset "FuelEconomy.csv"

Create a Linear Regressor and fit the dataset in this and then print the training and testing score for this regressor.

Note: Inside the function "traintestsplit" use the "random_state = 42".Split the data into 70% in training data and 30% in testing data.

To know more about randomstate please read the document given regarding randomstate.

Output

Print the testing and training scores in separate lines rounded off to 3 decimal places.
