Problem Statement :
We want to find out the average amount of funding given to startups which are in either Bangalore or in New Delhi.

For this - rather than considering all the startups, take a sample of size 75 (with replacement). Then find the average amount of funding from this sample and calculate the Sampling Error.

Sampling Error = Average(Population) - Average(Sample)
Note:
Take city name "Delhi" as "New Delhi".

Check the case-sensitiveness of cities also. That means - at some place, instead of "Bangalore", "bangalore" is given. Take city name as "Bangalore"

Output :
 Print Sampling Error
